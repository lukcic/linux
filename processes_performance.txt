Process have one or more threads. Processes are created by clonning another process (fork function) and (not always) replacing program in this process.
Parent process id is called PPID. Kernel is starting init or systemd (PID 1), that is parent of most processes. 
If parrent process is killed, kernel gives child processes to init or systemd to managing. 

UID - identify number of user who created process (parent UID copy). Process can be modyfied by his owner and superuser
EUID - effective UID. EUID and UID are the same, excluding processes that used setuid. Differences between identity and permissions 

GID and EGID - the same as above, but for groups (setgid)
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Jobs:
[COMMAND] & -run process in background (unzip eg.)

jobs - lists background processes with job ID

SIGNALS
Signals are interrup requests (żadania przerwania) on processes.
-can be send betweenn processes as communication form
-can be send by terminal to kill, stop or hang program (CTRL +C, CTRL +D)
-can be send by admin (kill)
-can be send by kernel to cumminicate with process or when process try unallowable instruction (divide by 0)

Process can handle signal (if it has this function) or kernel will do standard signal procedure.
After capturing and handling, process will continue it`s work. 
Processes can block or ignore signals (without KILL and STOP).

kill -l                 -list all signals

kill -[SIGANL] [PID]    -sending signal to pid
kill [PID]              -by default TERM signal is send

TSTP - light STOP, sended by user (CTRL + Z), process is cleaning and sending STOP to himself

KILL - is non blocked and kills process by kernel, cannot be captured and handled 
kill -KILL [PID]
kill -9 [PID] 

INT - send by terminal (CTRL + C), process should stop actual operation. 
If signal is captured, process should terminate himslef, if not process should let be killed (default action)
Programs with commandline sholuld stop actual task and wait for new data input. 

TERM -request of imidiatelly termination. Program shuold clean ant terminate himself.
kill -TRM [PID]
kill -15 [PID] 

STOP -stopping the process till CONT signal comes 
kill -STOP [PID] 

CONT - awake process after STOP
kill -CONT [PID]

HUP -some deamons after this signal will reload configuration (reset).
Hang up - reset of terminal. 

QUIT - similar to TERM, but with mem dump

-v                      -verbose
-n tcp 80               -show which process is using tcp socket (80)
-c [MOUNTPOINT]         -shows all processes that use any file from this filesystem , then use 'ps up [PID]' to check name of process, or use -v
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
watch [COMMAND] -runs command periodycally (2 seconds by default)
-n X -time of repeating (default 2s)

nohup [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] -no nahg up, run command immune to hangups (non tty output). Process works after closing your terminal.

HTOP #################################
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Priorities:
0-99    -real time processes
100-139 -normal processes, lower value, higher priority

Standard priority of normal process: 120.

/proc/[PROCESS_ID]/sched  -file that contains info about process, for example static priority (prio)

ps -el  -list priorities of all processes (PRI column), ps -Al works similar
Priorities listed that way have priority values reduced (always -40) for historical reasons!

Priorities viewed by top command have priority value substracted by 100 (-100), so real time processes have negative value.
Normal processes have value 0 - 39.

Nice:
Nice of process - value that inform kernel how process will be regarded in relation to other processes that compete for processor time.
0                 -default process starts with nice 0 (priority 120).
from -20 to 19    -nice values, -20 -less nice process (higher priority), 19 -more nice process (lower priority)

nice [PROCESS_NAME] - start process with non standard priority (default 10)
-n [X]  -specific nice value
nice -n 5 ~/bin/longtask

renice [PROCESS_NAME] -change nice of running process
-X      -specific nice value
-p [PID] -specific PID
-u [USERNAME] -specific processes of given user
-g [GROUPNAME] -specific processes of given group
sudo renice -5 8829

VMSTAT - statistics of processors, processes and memory

vmstat [TIME_BETWEEN_MEASSURE] [AMMOUT_OF_MEASURRES]    -time in seconds, if without second paramter, then vmstat works utils stopped 
us -user space, time useb by users processes
sy -system time, time used by system processes (kernel)
id -idle time
wa -wait, time for i/o waiting
st- stolen, parameter of stolen processor cycles in % (system is ready to work, but hypervisor do not allocate processor time for this vm)

Userspace time and system time should by 50% (every). Idle time should be larger than 0. 
If server is used for one application that use a lot of processor, then most processor time should be used for userspace.

cs -context switching, how many times processor switched working processes

procs:
-r -running processes 
-b -processes blocked in i/o operations (waiting)
-swpd -processes running with memmory swapped to disk (if too large, then more RAM needed)??
-si -swapped in to RAM from disk
-so -swapped out from RAM to disk

memmory:
-avm -active virtual memmory (used)
-fre -free virtual memmory
-page -

TIP: Application logs and database logs should be written on different phisical disks (2 processes writes on the same time).

Memory
Kernel manages memory in units called virtual pages (strony) - 4KiB and larger. 
Every page is mapped to phisical memory (RAM od virtual memory on disk). Page tables is kernel tool for managing pages.
Kernel may allocate more memory than phisical RAM using swap space. 
Paging (stronicowanie) - process of swapping data from SWAP (disk) memory to phisical RAM.
Kernel is managing pages and decide which of them are used rarely. This ones are swapped to disk memory. 

virtual memory = phisical memory + ammount of used swap

swapon -s       #check how many swap memmory is currently used

ulimit -m 32000000 -set memmory limit (32MiB) for processes that run in this shell (setrlimit function)
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Performance problems:
-check using top which process takes 50% of cpu or more
-if no one large process, then check processes that uses more than 10%
-check average load using uptime
-check using vmstat if processor goes to idle
-check how often system pages cache memmory, if often then RAM must be added 
-if no cache paging but and a lot of i/o operations on disk then some process takes too much disk usage
-search this process using top and kill it for check
-if helped, then set lower priority (renice) 
-if not, check network use of process and network latency 
-DNS queries (it`s response time) very often caused problems
